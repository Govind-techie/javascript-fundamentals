## ðŸ“˜ Part-1: JavaScript Fundamentals (Variables & Basic Operations)

This part establishes the **core foundations of JavaScript programming** â€” focusing on how data is stored, manipulated, and the basic rules that govern JavaScript syntax.
Essential for anyone starting their JavaScript journey or wanting to solidify their understanding of fundamental programming concepts.

### âœ… Topics Covered:
- **variables** â€“ Understanding variable declaration using `var`, `let`, and `const` and their scope differences.
- **dataTypes** â€“ Exploring JavaScript's primary data types: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, and BigInt.
- **operations** â€“ Learning basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`) and how they work with numbers.
- **NaN** â€“ Understanding the "Not-a-Number" value and when it occurs in calculations.
- **operatorPrecedence** â€“ Mastering the order in which JavaScript evaluates different operators.
- **assignmentOperator** â€“ Working with various assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).
- **unaryOperator** â€“ Understanding operators that work with a single operand (`++`, `--`, `!`).
- **identifierRules** â€“ Learning the rules for naming variables and functions in JavaScript.
- **boolean** â€“ Working with `true`/`false` values and understanding boolean logic.
- **strings** â€“ Mastering string creation, manipulation, and common string operations.

## ðŸ“˜ Part-2: JavaScript Control Flow & User Interaction

This part focuses on **program flow control and user interaction** â€” covering how to make decisions in code, work with modern string formatting, and interact with users through browser dialogs.
Essential for building interactive and dynamic JavaScript applications.

### âœ… Topics Covered:
- **templateLiterals** â€“ Using modern string interpolation with backticks (`) and ${expressions} for cleaner string formatting.
- **comparisonOperator** â€“ Understanding comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) and their use in conditions.
- **conditionalStatements** â€“ Mastering `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for decision-making in code.
- **logicalOperator** â€“ Working with `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) to combine multiple conditions.
- **truthy & falsy values** â€“ Understanding which values JavaScript considers 'truthy' or 'falsy' in conditional contexts.
- **switchStatement** â€“ Using switch-case statements for multiple conditional branching.
- **alert & prompts** â€“ Interacting with users through browser dialogs using `alert()`, `prompt()`, and `confirm()`.

## ðŸ“˜ Part-3: JavaScript Strings & Arrays

This part dives into **string manipulation and array operations** â€” exploring how to work with text data efficiently and handle collections of data using arrays.
Essential for managing and processing data structures in JavaScript applications.

### âœ… Topics Covered:
- **stringMethods** â€“ Mastering built-in string manipulation methods like `slice()`, `split()`, `trim()`, `toLowerCase()`, `toUpperCase()`, and more.
- **array** â€“ Understanding array creation, accessing elements, and basic array operations.
- **arrayMethods** â€“ Working with essential array methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `splice()`, `slice()`, and more.
- **arrayReference** â€“ Understanding how arrays are referenced in memory and the implications of array copying.
- **constantArray** â€“ Learning about array mutability with `const` declarations and its practical applications.
- **nestedArray** â€“ Working with multi-dimensional arrays and accessing nested array elements.

## ðŸ“˜ Part-4: JavaScript Loops & Iterations

This part focuses on **program iterations and loop structures** â€” covering different ways to repeat code execution and iterate over data structures.
Essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing collections of data efficiently.

### âœ… Topics Covered:
- **forLoop** â€“ Understanding the traditional `for` loop structure and its components for controlled iterations.
- **whileLoop** â€“ Working with `while` loops for condition-based iterations.
- **breakKeyword** â€“ Using the `break` statement to control loop execution flow.
- **LoopsOnArrays** â€“ Applying loops to iterate through array elements and perform operations.
- **forOfLoop** â€“ Using the modern `for...of` loop for simpler array iterations.
- **todoApp** â€“ Building a console-based todo application using JavaScript logic.

## ðŸ“˜ Part-5: JavaScript Objects & Built-in Objects

This part explores **object fundamentals and JavaScript's built-in objects** â€” covering how to create and work with objects, handle nested data structures, and utilize built-in JavaScript objects.
Essential for organizing data and leveraging JavaScript's object-oriented features.

### âœ… Topics Covered:
- **objectLiterals** â€“ Understanding object creation, properties, and methods using literal notation.
- **nestedObject** â€“ Working with complex object structures containing nested objects and arrays.
- **arrayOfObject** â€“ Managing collections of objects and accessing their properties.
- **mathObject** â€“ Exploring JavaScript's built-in Math object for mathematical operations.
- **guessingGame** â€“ Building a number guessing game utilizing Math objects and Math methods along with loops and conditional statements.
