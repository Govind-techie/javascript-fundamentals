# javascript-fundamentals

- This repository is a structured approach to mastering JavaScript fundamentals — built as I progress from basic programming concepts to advanced JavaScript features.
- It covers core JavaScript concepts including variables, data types, operators, and basic programming constructs, and will expand as I continue learning.
- Perfect for beginners starting their programming journey with JavaScript, and for anyone wanting to build a solid foundation in modern JavaScript programming.

## 📘 Part-1: JavaScript Fundamentals (Variables & Basic Operations)

This part establishes the **core foundations of JavaScript programming** — focusing on how data is stored, manipulated, and the basic rules that govern JavaScript syntax.
Essential for anyone starting their JavaScript journey or wanting to solidify their understanding of fundamental programming concepts.

### ✅ Topics Covered:
- **variables** – Understanding variable declaration using `var`, `let`, and `const` and their scope differences.
- **dataTypes** – Exploring JavaScript's primary data types: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, and BigInt.
- **operations** – Learning basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`) and how they work with numbers.
- **NaN** – Understanding the "Not-a-Number" value and when it occurs in calculations.
- **operatorPrecedence** – Mastering the order in which JavaScript evaluates different operators.
- **assignmentOperator** – Working with various assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).
- **unaryOperator** – Understanding operators that work with a single operand (`++`, `--`, `!`).
- **identifierRules** – Learning the rules for naming variables and functions in JavaScript.
- **boolean** – Working with `true`/`false` values and understanding boolean logic.
- **strings** – Mastering string creation, manipulation, and common string operations.
